# Agentic PMS — READ THIS FIRST IN EVERY SESSION

Employee Performance Management System, extracted as a product from the AH
platform. Client-deliverable: dedicated instance per client, deploy-and-
transfer + AMC. Spec + extraction plan live with Nilesh (Agentic PMS
Product Specification v1.0; Extraction Plan) — ask if not provided.

## Session bootstrap
1. Read this file.
2. Skills auto-load from .claude/skills/ — trust them over improvisation:
   conventions · migrations · security-permissions · extraction-playbook ·
   secrets-and-shipping.
3. `cd server && npm test` — 9 tests must pass before and after your work.
4. Never commit node_modules/, dist/, or any secret (scan in the shipping skill).

## State (update this section every session)
- Phase 0 (People Core): SCAFFOLDED 27-Aug-2026 — runner, schema 001,
  auth (JWT + dev-login), permissions (parity gate), employees mirror +
  validated CSV import (9/9 tests), seed 002, deploy files, frontend shell.
- Phase 0 remaining: mail interface + send-mode, storage iface, notifications
  read API, run against a real Postgres (exit test in plan §3).
- Phases 1-4: see Extraction Plan. Source repo for lifting:
  nileshsatpute82/agentic-humans-platform (route-prefix lifting only).

## Hard rules (details in skills)
tenant_id everywhere · modules never import each other's internals · boot
fails on migration error · per-row errors on batch ops · deterministic
numbers, AI narrates · employee master is a CSV-synced mirror · no dummy data
· no secrets in repo · no AH git history ever.
